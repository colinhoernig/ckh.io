      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a full-stack software engineer working in the startup space in the beautiful city of Chicago, IL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years I have been working with a great music-based startup known as Music Dealers, where we&amp;rsquo;ve built a platform that provides independent artists with a new revenue stream by giving them a stage to share their music with the world.  In 2015 we celebrated $15 million being paid out to our incredible artist community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the founder of CKH Development, a web consulting and development company.  We solve real-world problems by building products that give clients a competitive advantage through a variety of channels.  We focus on building efficient, scalable, and reliable web and mobile applications using the tools and technology that best fit the job at hand. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to build a beautiful product quickly, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@niloc.io&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;working,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m usually hacking on personal projects or contributing to the open source software community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tid-bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B.S. Computer Science from Purdue University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love everything tech &amp;mdash; hardware, software, and everything in-between&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate stagnation, and am a big proponent of continuous education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source is the future; embrace it with open arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
