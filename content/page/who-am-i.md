I am a full-stack software engineer working in the startup space in the beautiful city of Chicago, IL.

For the past two years I have been working with a great music-based startup known as Music Dealers, where we've built a platform that provides independent artists with a new revenue stream by giving them a stage to share their music with the world.  In 2015 we celebrated $15 million being paid out to our incredible artist community.

I am the founder of CKH Development, a web consulting and development company.  We solve real-world problems by building products that give clients a competitive advantage through a variety of channels.  We focus on building efficient, scalable, and reliable web and mobile applications using the tools and technology that best fit the job at hand. If you're looking to build a beautiful product quickly, please [get in touch](mailto:hi@ckhdev.io).  We'd love to hear from you.

When I'm not "working," I'm usually hacking on personal projects or contributing to the open source software community.

Other tid-bits:

- B.S. Computer Science from Purdue University
- I love everything tech --- hardware, software, and everything in-between
- I hate stagnation, and am a big proponent of continuous education
- Open source is the future; embrace it with open arms
