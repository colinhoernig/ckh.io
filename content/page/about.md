- Accomplished web engineer with more than 7 years of experience in building for the web.
- Proven ability to turn an idea into robust, well-tested, maintainable software and get it shipped on spec, on budget, and on time.
- Open Source advocate with a strong passion for learning and teaching others.

For the past three years I had been working with Music Dealers, a music licensing startup in Chicago, to build a platform for 20k+ independent musicians to share 200k+ tracks with the world, easily licensable by anybody in the world.  My wife and I are fulfilling a dream of moving west, so I am now looking for a full-time remote or on-site position around Colorado Springs, CO.

My primary goals are to never become stagnant and always continue learning, and to apply the knowledge gained in order to solve real world problems.  I also love teaching the things that I've learned.

These days I spend my time working with modern Javascript (Node.js, React.js, Ember.js), Ruby, Python, modern PHP (Laravel), as well as a bit of Golang.  I love writing clean, well documented, and well tested code.

I am the founder of CKH Development, a web consulting and development company.  We solve real-world problems by building products that give clients a competitive advantage through a variety of channels.  We focus on building efficient, scalable, and reliable web applications using the tools and technology that best fit the job at hand. If you're looking to build a beautiful product quickly, please [get in touch](mailto:me@ckh.io).  We'd love to hear from you.

When I'm not "working," I'm usually hacking on personal projects, contributing to the open source software community, or out exploring nature.

Other tid-bits:

- B.S. Computer Science from Purdue University
- I love everything tech --- hardware, software, and everything in-between
- I hate stagnation, and am a big proponent of continuous education
- Open source is the future; embrace it with open arms
- Nature lover --- I spend a lot of time backpacking and camping in the mountains of Colorado
