I am a full-stack software engineer.  For the past three years I had been working with Music Dealers, a great music-based Chicago startup, to build a music licensing platform that provides independent artists with a new revenue stream by giving them a stage to share their music with the world.  In 2015 we celebrated $15 million being paid out to our incredible artist community.

I am the founder of CKH Development, a web consulting and development company.  We solve real-world problems by building products that give clients a competitive advantage through a variety of channels.  We focus on building efficient, scalable, and reliable web applications using the tools and technology that best fit the job at hand. If you're looking to build a beautiful product quickly, please [get in touch](mailto:me@ckh.io).  We'd love to hear from you.

When I'm not "working," I'm usually hacking on personal projects, contributing to the open source software community, or out exploring nature.

Other tid-bits:

- B.S. Computer Science from Purdue University
- I love everything tech --- hardware, software, and everything in-between
- I hate stagnation, and am a big proponent of continuous education
- Open source is the future; embrace it with open arms
- Nature lover --- I spend a lot of time backpacking and camping in the mountains of Colorado
