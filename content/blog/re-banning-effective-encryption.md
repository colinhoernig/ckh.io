Let me get off the topic of Bernie vs. Clinton for a moment in order to discuss something that has a very serious impact on all of us.
US Senator Dianne Feinstein and US Senator Richard Burr *NEED* to get out of Congress.  Feinstein-Burr are *co-sponsors* on bill that *SEEKS TO BAN* effective encryption.  Here's an analogy by [/u/drawkbox](https://www.reddit.com/user/drawkbox):

> "World class security system, yet plenty of keys under rocks in the backyard....Going without encryption is another level of trust, like leaving your window open on vacation and putting a note that says, only Sally the neighbor can come in through the window, please (Sally being the gov't). Guess what, Sally won't be the only one coming in."

Feinstein and Burr have been sponsors/supporters of *SOPA*, *PIPA*, and *CISA* bills, all of which were/are highly detrimental to the right to privacy.

Feinstein is 82 years old, and Burr is 60.  We, the Gen X'ers and Millenials, CANNOT let baby boomers continue to hold positions within Congress, as these are people that have ZERO understanding of technology and ZERO understanding of the MOST SERIOUS implications of banning effective encryption.  Those that have no understanding of the importance of encryption just think "Oh! They're using it to protect us from terrorists." or "I have nothing to hide, therefore I don't need encryption."  *_The idiotic support of such bills is contagious._*

*REMEMBER THIS:* In November 2016, *88%* of Congressional seats are *up for re-election*.  We NEED to elect members that *UNDERSTAND* the need for encryption and will fight for the rights of the people.
