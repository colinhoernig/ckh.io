title: Looking Forward

You may consider this page a scratchpad for thoughts and ideas.  Just as well,
it acts as a platform for sharing knowledge on a variety of subjects in the realm
of technology.

It is the nearing the New Year, and I am _looking forward_ to see what 2016 holds.
2015 has been an incredible year.  Notably:

- I married my best friend, Alexa. --- _September 2015_
- I spontaneously hopped on an airplane and stormchased the largest front that
the Pacific Northwest has seen in years.  Snorkel deep powder conditions in Whistler,
B.C. were all time. --- _December 2015_

2015 was also a great year for [Music Dealers](http://musicdealers.com):

- celebrated $15 million paid out to independent artists, which helped change
the lives of many musicians.  Looking back, it is a wonderful feeling to be a
part of something that has had such an impact within the music industry. --- _January 2015_
- the [Deal Board](http://dealboard.musicdealers.com) was rebuilt from scratch
and launched, receiving 900+ artist submissions in the first week. --- _August 2015_
- a brand new [Curated Playlists](http://musicdealers.com/#!/curated-playlists)
page was launched...a fun collab between Marketing & Technology --- _December 2015_

Throughout 2015, I have spent a considerable amount of time working with some
very cool technologies including [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/),
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/)
among others.  The Deal Board mentioned above was built using Ember as the
front-end, with a REST API built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).  The
JavaScript ecosystem changes extremely rapidly, but I feel confident that the
future of JavaScript is **very promising**.

In the future, I'll write more about web technology, including how this blog was
built.
